# tetr-is-you
Tetris implemented in Baba Is You

## How to play
Keep pressing space or return until the baba on the bottom left turn into flags. Make input (Keyboard arrows LRUD) or skip it. The active block will move left or right on key input L/R. It will instead rotate clockwise/counterclockwise on key U/D. The game keeps listening on the user's input until the user declines to make one. Then it moves the block one step down or fix the block to the ground.
